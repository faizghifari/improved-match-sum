# Improved Match-Sum: Novel Extractive Summarization

This project is based on paper [Extractive Summarization as Text Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08795), and the dataset we use (i.e., CNN/DailyMail dataset) and some of the code here are used directly from the author's repository [here](https://github.com/maszhongming/MatchSum)

Our model can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1249xpWMWz-V_QXlHEvTbXKe_s0kGgfbD?usp=sharing)
